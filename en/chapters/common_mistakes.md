## Introduction

This chapter will detail common mistakes that are made, and how to avoid them.

* [Don't Trust Formspec Submissions](#dont-trust-formspec-submissions)
* [Set ItemStacks After Changing Them](#set-itemstacks-after-changing-them)

## Never Store ObjectRefs (ie: players or entities)

If the Object a ObjectRef represents is deleted - for example, the player goes
offline or the entity is unloaded - then calling any methods will result in a crash.

Don't do this:

{% highlight lua %}
minetest.register_on_joinplayer(function(player)
    local function func()
        local pos = player:get_pos() -- BAD!
        -- `player` is stored in the scope then accessed later.
        -- If the player leaves in that second, the server *will* crash.
    end

    minetest.after(1, func)

    foobar[player:get_player_name()] = player
    -- RISKY
    -- It's recommended to just not do this
    -- use minetest.get_connected_players() and minetest.get_player_by_name() instead.
end)
{% endhighlight %}

instead, do this:

{% highlight lua %}
minetest.register_on_joinplayer(function(player)
    local function func(name)
        -- Attempt to get the ref again
        local player = minetest.get_player_by_name(name)

        -- Check that the player is still online
        if player then
            -- Yay! This is fine
            local pos = player:get_pos()
        end
    end

    -- Pass the name into the function
    minetest.after(1, func, player:get_player_name())
end)
{% endhighlight %}

## Don't Trust Formspec Submissions

Malicious clients can submit formspecs whenever they like with whatever content
they like.

The following code has a vulnerability where any player can give
themself moderator privileges:

{% highlight lua %}
local function show_formspec(name)
    if not minetest.check_player_privs(name, { privs = true }) then
        return false
    end

    minetest.show_formspec(name, "modman:modman", [[
        size[3,2]
        field[0,0;3,1;target;Name;]
        button_exit[0,1;3,1;sub;Promote]
    ]])
    return true
})

minetest.register_on_player_receive_fields(function(player, formname, fields)
    -- BAD! Missing privilege check here!

    local privs = minetest.get_player_privs(fields.target)
    privs.kick  = true
    privs.ban   = true
    minetest.set_player_privs(fields.target, privs)
    return true
end)
{% endhighlight %}

Instead, do this:

{% highlight lua %}
minetest.register_on_player_receive_fields(function(player, formname, fields)
    if not minetest.check_player_privs(name, { privs = true }) then
        return false
    end

    -- code
end)
{% endhighlight %}

## Set ItemStacks After Changing Them

Notice how it's simply called an `ItemStack` in the API, not an `ItemStackRef`,
similar to `InvRef`. This is because an `ItemStack` isn't a reference - it's a
copy. Stacks work on a copy of the data rather than the stack in the inventory.
This means that modifying a stack won't actually modify that stack in the inventory.

Don't do this:

{% highlight lua %}
local inv = player:get_inventory()
local stack = inv:get_stack("main", 1)
stack:get_meta():set_string("description", "Partially eaten")
-- BAD! Modification will be lost
{% endhighlight %}

Do this:

{% highlight lua %}
local inv = player:get_inventory()
local stack = inv:get_stack("main", 1)
stack:get_meta():set_string("description", "Partially eaten")
inv:set_stack("main", 1, stack)
-- Correct! Item stack is set
{% endhighlight %}

The behaviour of callbacks is slightly more complicated. Modifying an itemstack you
are given will change it for the caller too, and any subsequent callbacks. However
it will only be saved in the engine if the callback caller sets it.

Avoid this:

{% highlight lua %}
minetest.register_on_item_eat(function(hp_change, replace_with_item, itemstack, user, pointed_thing)
    itemstack:get_meta():set_string("description", "Partially eaten")
    -- Almost correct! Data will be lost if another callback cancels the behaviour
end)
{% endhighlight %}

If no callbacks cancel, then the stack will be set and the description will be updated.
If a callback cancels then the update may be lost. It's better to do this instead:

{% highlight lua %}
minetest.register_on_item_eat(function(hp_change, replace_with_item, itemstack, user, pointed_thing)
    itemstack:get_meta():set_string("description", "Partially eaten")
    user:get_inventory():set_stack("main", user:get_wield_index(), itemstack)
    -- Correct, description will always be set!
end)
{% endhighlight %}

If the callbacks cancel or the callback runner doesn't set the stack,
then our update will still be set.
If the callbacks or the callback runner does set the stack, then our
set_stack doesn't matter.
