## Introduction

This chapter details common mistakes, and how to avoid them.

* [Don't Trust Formspec Submissions](#dont-trust-formspec-submissions)
* [Set ItemStacks After Changing Them](#set-itemstacks-after-changing-them)

## Never Store ObjectRefs (ie: players or entities)

If the object an ObjectRef represents is deleted - for example, if the player goes
offline or the entity is unloaded - then calling methods on that object
will result in a crash.

For example, don't do this:

```lua
minetest.register_on_joinplayer(function(player)
    local function func()
        local pos = player:get_pos() -- BAD!
        -- `player` is stored then accessed later.
        -- If the player leaves in that second, the server *will* crash.
    end

    minetest.after(1, func)

    foobar[player:get_player_name()] = player
    -- RISKY
    -- It's not recommended to do this.
    -- Use minetest.get_connected_players() and
    -- minetest.get_player_by_name() instead.
end)
```

Do this instead:

```lua
minetest.register_on_joinplayer(function(player)
    local function func(name)
        -- Attempt to get the ref again
        local player = minetest.get_player_by_name(name)

        -- Check that the player is still online
        if player then
            -- Yay! This is fine
            local pos = player:get_pos()
        end
    end

    -- Pass the name into the function
    minetest.after(1, func, player:get_player_name())
end)
```

## Don't Trust Formspec Submissions

Malicious clients can submit formspecs whenever they like, with
whatever content they like.

For example, the following code has a vulnerability which allows players to
give themselves moderator privileges:

```lua
local function show_formspec(name)
    if not minetest.check_player_privs(name, { privs = true }) then
        return false
    end

    minetest.show_formspec(name, "modman:modman", [[
        size[3,2]
        field[0,0;3,1;target;Name;]
        button_exit[0,1;3,1;sub;Promote]
    ]])
    return true
})

minetest.register_on_player_receive_fields(function(player,
        formname, fields)
    -- BAD! Missing privilege check here!

    local privs = minetest.get_player_privs(fields.target)
    privs.kick  = true
    privs.ban   = true
    minetest.set_player_privs(fields.target, privs)
    return true
end)
```

Add a privilege check to solve this:

```lua
minetest.register_on_player_receive_fields(function(player,
        formname, fields)
    if not minetest.check_player_privs(name, { privs = true }) then
        return false
    end

    -- code
end)
```

## Set ItemStacks After Changing Them

Have you noticed that it's simply called an `ItemStack` in the API, not an `ItemStackRef`,
similar to `InvRef`? This is because an `ItemStack` isn't a reference - it's a
copy. Stacks work on a copy of the data rather than the stack in the inventory.
This means that modifying a stack won't actually modify that stack in the inventory.

For example, don't do this:

```lua
local inv = player:get_inventory()
local stack = inv:get_stack("main", 1)
stack:get_meta():set_string("description", "Partially eaten")
-- BAD! Modification will be lost
```

Do this instead:

```lua
local inv = player:get_inventory()
local stack = inv:get_stack("main", 1)
stack:get_meta():set_string("description", "Partially eaten")
inv:set_stack("main", 1, stack)
-- Correct! Item stack is set
```

The behaviour of callbacks is slightly more complicated. Modifying an `ItemStack` you
are given will change it for the caller too, and any subsequent callbacks. However,
it will only be saved in the engine if the callback caller sets it.

```lua
minetest.register_on_item_eat(function(hp_change, replace_with_item,
        itemstack, user, pointed_thing)
    itemstack:get_meta():set_string("description", "Partially eaten")
    -- Almost correct! Data will be lost if another
    -- callback cancels the behaviour
end)
```

If no callbacks cancel this, the stack will be set and the description will be updated,
but if a callback does cancel this, then the update may be lost.

It's better to do this instead:

```lua
minetest.register_on_item_eat(function(hp_change, replace_with_item,
        itemstack, user, pointed_thing)
    itemstack:get_meta():set_string("description", "Partially eaten")
    user:get_inventory():set_stack("main", user:get_wield_index(),
            itemstack)
    -- Correct, description will always be set!
end)
```

If the callbacks cancel or the callback runner doesn't set the stack,
then the update will still be set.
If the callbacks or the callback runner set the stack, then the use of
set_stack doesn't matter.
